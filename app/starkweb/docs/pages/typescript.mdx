# TypeScript

## Requirements

Starkweb is designed to be as type-safe as possible! Things to keep in mind:

- Types currently require using TypeScript >=5.0.4.
- [TypeScript doesn't follow semver](https://www.learningtypescript.com/articles/why-typescript-doesnt-follow-strict-semantic-versioning) and often introduces breaking changes in minor releases.
- Changes to types in this repository are considered non-breaking and are usually released as patch changes (otherwise every type enhancement would be a major version!).
- It is highly recommended that you lock your `starkweb/react` and `typescript` versions to specific patch releases and upgrade with the expectation that types may be fixed or upgraded between any release.
- The non-type-related public API of Starkweb still follows semver very strictly.

To ensure everything works correctly, make sure your `tsconfig.json` has [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) mode set to `true`.

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Config Types

By default React Context does not work well with type inference. To support strong type-safety across the React Context boundary, there are two options available:

- Declaration merging to **register** your `config` globally with TypeScript.
- `config` property to pass your `config` directly to hooks.

### Declaration Merging

[Declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html) allows you to **register** your `config` globally with TypeScript. The `Register` type enables Starkweb to infer types in places that wouldn't normally have access to type info via React Context alone.

To set this up, add the following declaration to your project. Below, we co-locate the declaration merging and the `config` set up.

```ts
import { createConfig, http } from "starkweb";
import { mainnet, sepolia } from "starkweb/chains";

declare module "starkweb" {
  // [!code focus]
  interface Register {
    // [!code focus]
    config: typeof config; // [!code focus]
  } // [!code focus]
} // [!code focus]

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet, sepolia],
  transports: {
    [mainnet.chain_id]: http(),
    [sepolia.chain_id]: http(),
  },
});
```

Since the `Register` type is global, you only need to add it once in your project. Once set up, you will get strong type-safety across your entire project. For example, query hooks will type `chainId` based on your `config`'s `chains`.

### Hook `config` Property

For cases where you have more than one Starkweb `config` or don't want to use the declaration merging approach, you can pass a specific `config` directly to hooks via the `config` property.

```ts
import { createConfig, http } from "starkweb";
import { mainnet, sepolia } from "starkweb/chains";

export const configA = createConfig({
  // [!code focus]
  chains: [mainnet], // [!code focus]
  transports: {
    // [!code focus]
    [mainnet.chain_id]: http(), // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]

export const configB = createConfig({
  // [!code focus]
  chains: [sepolia], // [!code focus]
  transports: {
    // [!code focus]
    [sepolia.chain_id]: http(), // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

## Const-Assert ABIs & Typed Data

Starkweb can infer types based on [ABIs](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch15-01-contract-class-abi.html) and [SNIP-12](https://github.com/Starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-12.md) Typed Data definitions. This achieves full end-to-end type-safety from your contracts to your frontend and enlightened developer experience by autocompleting ABI item names, catching misspellings, inferring argument and return types (including overloads), and more.

For this to work, you must either [const-assert](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions) ABIs and Typed Data (more info below) or define them inline. For example, `useContractRead`'s `abi` configuration parameter:

```ts
const { data } = useContractRead({
  abi: […], // <--- defined inline // [!code focus]
})
```

```ts
const abi = […] as const // <--- const assertion // [!code focus]
const { data } = useContractRead({ abi })
```

If type inference isn't working, it's likely you forgot to add a `const` assertion or define the configuration parameter inline. Also, make sure your ABIs, Typed Data definitions, and [TypeScript configuration](#requirements) are valid and set up correctly.

:::tip
Unfortunately [TypeScript doesn't support importing JSON `as const` yet](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32063). Check out the [Starkweb CLI](#TODO/cli) to help with this! It can automatically fetch ABIs from Etherscan and other block explorers, resolve ABIs from your projects, generate React Hooks, and more.

Anywhere you see the `abi` or `types` configuration property, you can likely use const-asserted or inline ABIs and Typed Data to get type-safety and inference.
