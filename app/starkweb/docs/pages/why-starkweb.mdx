# Why We Built Starkweb üê∫

## The Problems

Building applications on Starknet presents unique challenges. Developers must enable wallet connections, handle multi-chain support, sign messages, process transactions, monitor events and state changes, and refresh data while providing an intuitive user experience. In addition, Starknet's evolving ecosystem requires constant adaptation to new updates and best practices.

Starkweb addresses these challenges, focusing on **developer experience**, **performance**, **comprehensive feature support**, and **stability**. With Starkweb, developers can concentrate on building high-quality applications without the usual friction.

## Developer Experience

Starkweb delivers a smooth developer experience with modular APIs, type-safe interfaces, and detailed documentation.

Starkweb's intuitive components and modular design make building and adapting Starknet applications easy. Starkweb's explicitly designed APIs allow developers to arrange, adapt, or replace components as needed. This approach helps developers build and learn Starknet's core principles.

With [strongly typed APIs](/typescript), Starkweb ensures smooth development by providing autocompletion, type inference, and error validation. Adding an ABI lets Starkweb guide developers with helpful suggestions and catch errors before they reach production.

The documentation details every module, with usage examples to simplify adoption. The Starkweb team follows a [documentation](https://gist.github.com/zsup/9434452) and [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) approach, ensuring the API remains intuitive, reliable, and easy to use.

## Performance

Efficient performance is key to delivering a smooth user experience. Slow interactions can lead users to leave an application.

Starkweb is optimized to minimize overhead, ensuring users can interact with Starknet apps quickly and without heavy downloads. By supporting tree-shaking and dead-code elimination, Starkweb helps keep bundle sizes small for faster load times.

Starkweb also optimizes the data layer with caching, deduplication, and persistence, minimizing redundant or slow data fetching and reducing RPC costs. This performance-first approach keeps applications responsive and efficient.

## Feature Coverage

Starkweb provides essential Starknet functionalities, including support for wallets, accounts, contracts, transactions, and signing operations. Its extensible API enables easy integration with various Starknet wallets, ensuring broad compatibility and a smooth user experience.

For developers who need more control, Starkweb's flexibility allows access to low-level functions for custom implementations. Starkweb also manages multi-chain support, so developers can focus on building their applications without getting bogged down in the details.

## Stability

Stability is fundamental to Starkweb and is designed to be a dependable tool for developers of all sizes.

Starkweb's rigorous test suite ensures compatibility and reliability across different versions of Starknet, minimizing potential issues. Each release undergoes thorough testing, including type tests against major dependencies like TypeScript, to maintain consistent performance across updates.

Following semantic versioning (semver), Starkweb provides confidence in each release. New features are introduced as opt-ins so developers can upgrade without worrying about breaking changes.

The Starkweb team is dedicated to actively maintaining and improving the APIs, ensuring they stay current with Starknet's latest developments.
